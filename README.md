# Challenge 05 - Work Day Scheduler

This project is to create a weather dashboard using OpenWeather API. When searching for a city, the user is presented with the current and future weather conditions for that city. The conditions that are displayed are temperature, wind speed, humidity, UV index and an icon respresentation of weather conditions. When user views the future weather conditions, the user is presented with a 5-day foracst that displays the date, an icon respresentation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed and humidity. 
All city searches are saved locally. Upon clicking on the city in the search history, the user is than presented with the current and future conditions fo rthat city.
